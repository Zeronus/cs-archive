PROGRAM I

All settings of x and y where print(x or not y) will print True

1. x = true     2. x = true     3. x = false
   y = true        y = false       y = false

   
PROGRAM II

For x%20//10 to equal to 1, the value of x%20 must be >= 10.
So if x%20 = 10, x must be 50
Therefore the smallest possible integer of x for the code to print True = 50
